# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using CNN-SVM Hybrid Model

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a hybrid model that combines the strengths of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for feature extraction and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for accurate prediction. The system supports predictions for multiple stock tickers at once and offers a user-friendly interface for input and visualization.
